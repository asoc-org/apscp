# Create solution from prioritization

Create a new solution based on spatial prioritization.

## Usage

``` r
create_solution_from_prioritization(
  name,
  project,
  prioritization,
  settings,
  column = NULL,
  metrics = NULL,
  id = uuid::UUIDgenerate()
)
```

## Arguments

- name:

  `character` value with the name.

- project:

  [`new_project()`](https://asoc-org.github.io/apscp/reference/new_project.md)
  object to which `prioritization `should be added.

- prioritization:

  `numeric` vector with a value for each planning unit to indicate zone
  allocations. For example, if the prioritization has three zones, then
  elements with values ranging between 1 and 3 correspond to planning
  units that are locked to the three zones (respectively). Additionally,
  elements with values ranging between 4 and 6 correspond to planning
  units that are selected as a priority for the three zones
  (respectively).

- settings:

  `list` of settings used to generate the solution.

- column:

  `character` value with column name used to store `prioritization` in
  the dataset that underpins `project`.

- metrics:

  `list` with evaluation metrics for prioritization. Defaults to `NULL`
  such that the metrics are calculated automatically.

- id:

  `character` value with unique identifier. Defaults to a random
  identifier
  ([`uuid::UUIDgenerate()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/uuid/man/UUIDgenerate.html)).

## Value

A
[`new_solution()`](https://asoc-org.github.io/apscp/reference/new_solution.md)
object.

## Settings format

The argument to `settings` must be a `list` with the following elements.

- `"features`":

  A `data.frame` with the theme and feature settings. These are used to
  specify the targets and weights considered for the features during
  optimization. Each row corresponds to a different feature, and it must
  have the following columns: `"id"`, `"name"`, `"column"`, `"zone"`,
  `"target"`, and `"weight"`. Note that target values must be expressed
  as a proportion (i.e., value between zero and one).

- `"locks"`:

  A `data.frame` with the settings to specify which locks are used to
  lock in planning units to a particular zone. Each row corresponds to a
  different lock, and it must have the following columns: `"id"`,
  `"name"`, `"column"`, and `"zone"`.

- `"costs"`:

  A `data.frame` with the cost settings. These are used to specify which
  costs are considered for each zone. Each row corresponds to a
  different cost, and it must have the following columns: `"id"`,
  `"name"`, `"zone"`, and `"weight"`.

- `"zones"`:

  A `data.frame` with settings for the multi-objective optimization.
  Each row corresponds to a different zone, and it must have the
  following columns: `"name"` and `"weight"`.

## Examples

``` r
# simulate data
p <- simulate_project()
s <- simulate_prioritization_settings(p)
d <- solve_prioritization(p, s, solver = "cbc", gap = 0.1)

# generate solution
x <- create_solution_from_prioritization(
  name = "sol",
  project = p,
  prioritization = d,
  settings = s
)

# print solution
print(x)
#> A <Solution> object.
